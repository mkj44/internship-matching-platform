## 🎯 Functional Dependencies

### STUDENT
- student_id → username, email, full_name, college_name, department, year_of_study, cgpa, phone
- email → student_id (UNIQUE)
- username → student_id (UNIQUE)

### RECRUITER
- recruiter_id → username, email, full_name, company_name, designation
- email → recruiter_id (UNIQUE)

### SKILLS
- skill_id → skill_name, category, description
- skill_name → skill_id (UNIQUE)

### INTERNSHIP
- internship_id → recruiter_id, title, type, description, company_name, location, stipend, minimum_cgpa, deadline, status
- internship_id, recruiter_id → (all internship attributes)

### STUDENT_SKILLS
- (student_id, skill_id) → proficiency_level, years_of_experience, certification_url
- Composite key ensures no duplicate skills per student

### APPLICATIONS
- application_id → student_id, internship_id, application_status, applied_at
- (student_id, internship_id) → application_id (UNIQUE - one application per student per internship)

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Application Workflow
```
1. STUDENT registers → creates STUDENT record
2. STUDENT adds skills → creates STUDENT_SKILLS records
3. RECRUITER posts job → creates INTERNSHIP and INTERNSHIP_SKILLS records
4. SYSTEM calculates matches → creates MATCH_RESULT records
5. STUDENT views recommendations → queries MATCH_RESULT
6. STUDENT applies → creates APPLICATION record
7. RECRUITER reviews → updates APPLICATION status
8. RECRUITER conducts tests → creates ASSESSMENT records
9. RECRUITER accepts/rejects → updates APPLICATION status → triggers notifications
```

## 📋 Normalization Analysis

### First Normal Form (1NF)
✓ All attributes are atomic
✓ No repeating groups
✓ Each cell contains single value

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
✓ All non-key attributes fully dependent on primary key
✓ No partial dependencies
✓ Composite keys properly defined

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
✓ No transitive dependencies
✓ All non-key attributes depend only on primary key
✓ Properly decomposed tables

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
✓ For every functional dependency X → Y, X is a superkey
✓ No redundancy in primary keys

## 🔍 Key Constraints

### Primary Keys
- Auto-increment INTEGER for all tables
- Ensures uniqueness and efficient indexing

### Foreign Keys
- ON DELETE CASCADE for dependent data
- ON DELETE RESTRICT for critical references
- Maintains referential integrity

### Unique Constraints
- username, email (STUDENT, RECRUITER, ADMIN)
- skill_name (SKILLS)
- (student_id, skill_id) in STUDENT_SKILLS
- (student_id, internship_id) in APPLICATIONS
- (internship_id, skill_id) in INTERNSHIP_SKILLS

### Check Constraints
- cgpa BETWEEN 0 AND 10
- year_of_study BETWEEN 1 AND 5
- weightage BETWEEN 1 AND 10
- proficiency_level in defined ENUM values
- application_status in defined ENUM values

## 📝 Notes

1. **MATCH_RESULT** is a materialized/computed table for performance
2. Junction tables (**STUDENT_SKILLS**, **INTERNSHIP_SKILLS**) resolve M:M relationships
3. All timestamps use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP with automatic updates
4. Soft deletes possible via `is_active` flags
5. Audit tables track all critical changes
